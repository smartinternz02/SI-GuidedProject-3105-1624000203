## Project Flow
- The user interacts with the UI (User Interface) to enter the data.
- Entered data is analyzed by the model which is integrated
- Once the model analyses the input, the prediction is showcased on the UI
 To accomplish this, we have to complete all the activities and tasks listed below
 ### Data Collection.
   - Collect the dataset or Create the dataset
 ### Data Preprocessing.
   - Import the Libraries.
   - Importing the dataset.
   - Checking for Null Values.
   - Data Visualization.
   - Taking care of Missing Data.
   - Label encoding.
   - One Hot Encoding.
   - Feature Scaling.
   - Splitting Data into Train and Test.
### Model Building
- Training and testing the model
- Evaluation of Model
### Application Building
- Create an HTML file
- Build a Python Code
